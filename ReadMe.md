Method named MNDRP for drug response prediction

Data:
     1)three cell line similarity networks

     2)two drug similarity networks
     
     3)known drug sensitive relationship 
     
Code: 
      1)FeatureLearning:get cell line/drug feature by  similarity networks

      2)Model: get the logistic model for drug response prediction
